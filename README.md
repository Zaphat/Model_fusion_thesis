## Quick Start
1. Navigate to [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com)
2. Create a new notebook
3. Upload these files to your Kaggle workspace
4. The required datasets and configurations will be automatically loaded

## Components

### Crop Yield Prediction
- CNN-based approach
- Decision tree implementation
- Enhanced CropNet model

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Baldwin, Alabama specific analysis
- Modality extraction tools
- Sentinel and USDA data processing

### Hate Content Detection
- Multimodal implementation
- Unimodal implementation

### Weather Classification
- Single and multi-class weather classification models

## Dependencies
All required dependencies are automatically handled by the Kaggle environment.

## Usage
1. Upload the repository files to your Kaggle workspace
2. Open the relevant notebook for your analysis
3. Run the notebooks in the Kaggle environment
